# ethereum-button

//THANK YOU FOR VIEWING!!

    I've been learning a couple coding languages for about a month or so
    now and I think that it's about time I get into some projects no matter
    how small they may seem.

  Buttons:

    I learned css fundamentals and using colors with buttons.
    This was a bit guided by a tutorial but, no shame!

  Index|Page:

    This is where I played with the knowledge that I had. I understand
    that the project may not be organized up to your coding standards but, 
    I am a beginner and I could care less about what you think of my small
    successess. I made use of a list without any submitting or usefulness
    yet somehow I found it quite amusing, it having no use.

  MoreButtons:

    For this project, I decided to take a different approach. Im interested
    in crypto/blockchain tech so, I decided to replicate something simple 
    that I already felt comfortable doing. I replicated the button design that
    is current on https://ethereum.org/en/developers/. This felt good. I made
    use of almost all of my HTML + CSS knowledge so far AND I was able to plug
    my art even if only to myself???? OK!!!!!!!!

    It feels good that im actually comprehending this sort of thing. I had been
    in "Robotics Club" in school but other than that i hadn't been exposed to 
    devving at all. 

  Text|-> PDF Drive[In Progress]:

    This might be a challenge but, For this project that im working on, My goal 
    is to recreate my favourite book site, PDF Drive. 
    I will continue practice and implement my HTML and CSS knowledge to deliver 
    this website in the highest form of quality.

//I WONT BE QUITTING ANYTIME SOON
